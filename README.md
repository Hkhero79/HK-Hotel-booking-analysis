# Defining The Problem Objective
We all need a place to stay while visiting another city or a foreign nation for resting through the nights after a gruelling 
day of work or sightseeing. Hotels aim to provide accomodationservices to such visitors and go out of their way to provide acomfortable and relaxing experience to their guests byoffering several services - from in-room dining to parking, spa,
concierge service, etc.
The objective of this exercise is to perform Exploratory DataAnalysis on the given dataset which contains bookinginformation for some hotels. Using EDA, we will explore the 
Data and try to gain some valuable insights that can help theHotels strategize and improve.
